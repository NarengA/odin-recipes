        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Jelly is a semi-solid food substance made from fruit juice, sugar, and sometimes pectin or gelatin. It is typically used as a spread on bread or toast or as a filling in desserts. Jelly can also refer to a clear or translucent fruit spread made by boiling fruit juice with sugar and pectin. It is commonly used in desserts and confectionaries. </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 package (85g) of fruit-flavored gelatin</li>
            <li>2 cups of boiling water</li>
            <li>1 cup of cold water</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin by bringing 2 cups of water to a boil in a saucepan or kettle.</li><br>
            <li>While the water is heating, pour the contents of the fruit-flavored gelatin packet into a heat-safe bowl.</li><br>
            <li>Slowly and carefully pour the boiling water over the gelatin powder in the bowl. Stir continuously until the gelatin powder is completely dissolved.</li><br>
            <li>Once the gelatin is dissolved, add 1 cup of cold water to the mixture. Stir well to combine.</li><br>
            <li>Decide on the desired shape and serving vessels for your jelly. You can use individual molds, a large jelly mold, or even small cups.</li><br>
            <li>Lightly grease the inside of your chosen molds or cups with a non-stick spray or a small amount of oil.</li><br>
            <li>Pour the prepared jelly mixture into the greased molds or cups, dividing it evenly between them.</li><br>
            <li>Place the molds or cups in the refrigerator for the jelly to set. The time required for setting can vary, but it usually takes around 2-4 hours. Check the package instructions for specific guidance on setting times.</li><br>
            <li>Once the jelly is fully set, remove it from the refrigerator. If you used individual molds, you can gently tap them on the counter or immerse in warm water for a few seconds to help release the jelly. For cups, you can use a butter knife or the edge of a spoon to loosen the jelly from the sides.</li><br>
            <li>Carefully invert the molds or cups onto a plate or serving platter to release the jelly.</li><br>
            <li>Serve and enjoy your homemade jelly! You can garnish it with whipped cream, fruits, or any other toppings you prefer.</li>
