        <p>Baking a cake involves several steps. Here's a basic guide to get you started</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 cups sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup unsalted butter (at room temperature)</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients</li><br>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.</li><br>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy.</li><br>
            <li>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li><br>
            <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt.</li><br>
            <li>Gradually add the dry ingredient mixture to the butter mixture, alternating with the milk. Begin and end with the dry ingredients, mixing well after each addition.</li><br>
            <li>Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans. Smooth the tops.</li><br>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean.</li><br>
            <li>Remove the cakes from the oven and let them cool in the pans for about 10 minutes. Then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li><br>
            <li>Once the cakes are cooled, you can frost and decorate them as desired.</li><br>
        </ol>
