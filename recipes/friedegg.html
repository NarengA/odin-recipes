        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>Cooking oil or butter</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper (to taste)</li>
            <li>Optional: herbs, spices, or seasonings of your choice</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin by placing a non-stick skillet or frying pan on the stovetop burner. Heat the pan over medium heat.</li><br>
            <li>Add a small amount of cooking oil or butter to the pan. This helps prevent the egg from sticking to the pan during cooking. Allow the oil or butter to melt or heat up.</li><br>
            <li>Meanwhile, crack the egg into a small bowl. Be careful not to break the yolk. If desired, you can also break the yolk and mix it in the bowl before adding it to the pan.</li><br>
            <li>Season the egg with a pinch of salt and pepper, according to your taste preferences. You can also add any additional herbs, spices, or seasonings you like, such as paprika, garlic powder, or parsley.</li><br>
            <li>Once the oil or butter in the pan is hot, gently slide the egg from the bowl into the pan. Take care not to break the yolk as you transfer it.</li><br>
            <li>Allow the egg to cook for about 2-3 minutes on medium heat. During this time, you can choose to cover the pan with a lid to help cook the top part of the egg.</li><br>
            <li>The cooking time can be adjusted based on your preferred yolk consistency. If you like a runny yolk, leave the egg as it is for the desired runniness. For a fully cooked egg with a set yolk, carefully flip the egg using a spatula after about 2-3 minutes of cooking. Cook for an additional 1-2 minutes.</li><br>
            <li>Once the fried egg is cooked to your liking, carefully transfer it to a plate using a spatula. Take extra care not to break the yolk while doing so.</li><br>
            <li>Serve the fried egg hot. You can enjoy it on its own, with toast, as a topping for rice or salad, or incorporate it into a larger meal according to your preference.</li>
